## Objective:
**Phishing** is a solicitation tactic used by phishing artists to exploit the personal details of unsuspecting users. A phishing site is a fake website that looks similar in appearance but different in destination. Unsuspecting users post their data believing that these sites come from trusted financial institutions. Many anti-phishing technologies are constantly emerging, but scammers are creating new technology by breaking all anti-phishing mechanisms. Hence an effective phishing site prediction mechanism is needed. So in this project we will predict phishing sites and fish what's phishing you.

**Phishing** is a common attack on credulous people by
making them to disclose their unique information using
counterfeit websites. The objective of phishing website URLs is
to purloin the personal information like user name, passwords
and online banking transactions. Phishers use the websites
which are visually and semantically similar to those real
websites. As technology continues to grow, phishing techniques
started to progress rapidly and this needs to be prevented by
using anti-phishing mechanisms to detect phishing. Machine
learning is a powerful tool used to strive against phishing
attacks. This project surveys the features used for detection and
detection techniques using machine learning.
Phishing is popular among attackers, since it is easier to trick
someone into clicking a malicious link which seems legitimate
than trying to break through a computer‚Äôs defense systems. The
malicious links within the body of the message are designed to
make it appear that they go to the spoofed organization using
that organization‚Äôs logos and other legitimate contents.
Here, we explain phishing domain (or Fraudulent Domain)
characteristics, the features that distinguish them from
legitimate domains, why it is important to detect these domains,
and how they can be detected using machine learning and deep learning.
