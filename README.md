### - Objective:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; **[Phishing](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/phishing-attack-scam/)** is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.

An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.

As technology continues to grow, phishing techniques started to progress rapidly and this needs to be prevented by using anti-phishing mechanisms to detect phishing. Machine learning and deep Learning are powerful tools used to strive against phishing attacks. So in this project, we will predict phishing (Sites and Messages) and fish what's phishing you.
